# Write here your operation functions:


# Usage example:
num1 = 5
num2 = 3

# Team Member 1

# Team Member 3

# Team Member 4
result_divide = divide(num1, num2)
print("Division result:", result_divide)

# Team Member 5
result_exponentiate = exponentiate(num1, num2)
print("Exponentiation result:", result_exponentiate)
